# Risk Assessment Data Visualization Project

This project demonstrates my skills in compiling datasets for risk assessment and creating data visualizations that stakeholders can easily digest. The goal was to provide a clear overview of the organization's risk landscape, highlighting key metrics and insights through intuitive visualizations.

## Project Objectives
- **Compile a Dataset:** Gather data suitable for risk assessment.
- **Create Visualizations:** Develop visuals that effectively communicate risk-related information to stakeholders.
- **Comprehensive Reporting:** Provide a report that offers a thorough overview of the organization's security posture.

## Steps Taken

### 1. Define Project Objectives
I began by defining the project objectives and guidelines, using ChatGPT to help create a structured plan, ensuring a clear direction and focus.

### 2. Create Dataset
Based on the project guidelines, I requested ChatGPT to generate a dataset. The resulting `.csv` file included relevant categories such as **Compliance Area**, **Incident Count**, and **Risk Level**. This dataset provided the necessary data points to complete the project efficiently.

### 3. Import Data into Power BI
I imported the dataset into Power BI Desktop by selecting **'Get Data'**, choosing **'Text/CSV'**, and importing the `.csv` file. This step allowed me to start building the visualizations with the data provided.

### 4. Create Visualizations
Using the key data points, I created various visualizations, including KPI cards, charts, and graphs, to highlight important metrics. The report provides an overview of the total number of risks facing the organization, along with insights into risk categories, mitigation status, compliance areas, and trends. These visualizations offer stakeholders critical data at a glance, helping them understand the security posture and identify areas that require attention.

### 5. Edit and Stylize
I organized the visualizations in a logical flow and selected a professional theme with a color scheme that emphasizes the most critical aspects of the report. This styling choice ensures that important information stands out and is easily accessible to the viewer.
